NAME: AUSTIN TURNER
CLASS: CPE.401

FOR THIS SUBMISSION, THE FILE INCLUDES:  server.py, and client.py.

To run the server.py file, type:
$ server.py [server_port_number]

To run client.py, type:
$ client.py [user_id] [server_IP] [server_port]

For this submission, I have been able to register my device and get a response
from the server. I wasn't able, however, to receive more than one message from
a connection on the server side. I hope I have everything that you are looking
for then it relates to the protocol. Because I don't know what we are going
to use the protocol for, I don't know how you want my main file to be
structured.
