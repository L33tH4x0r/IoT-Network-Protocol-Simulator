To run the server.py file, type:

To run client.py, type:
$ client.py [user_id] [cleint_ip] [server_IP] [server_port]

For this submission, I created a DropBox account and registered an API key. I associated my server and my clients with this API key and used it to communicate with DropBox. Each client when they register with the server have a document created for them inside DropBox from the server. When clients want to communicate with each other, they download their file from DropBox and append the commands they're sending to the other client. After, they delete the existing file on the cloud and re-upload their file.
